Basically the smtp-faker directory has a following items:

# - A VS 2010 solution

# - SmtpServer class - which is basically a wrapper for firing up smtp sessions and dumping the resulting messages to a txt file

# - SmtpSession class - this is the smtp server session that handles the smtp protocol - gives the correct responses - but since it
    is a developer version - it does not check for validity of data entered i.e. whether the email addresses are correct etc - just
    if they have been entered according to the smtp specification

# - A number of helper classes to handle event handling etc


All up it allows you to run the app in a terminal and pipe all mail sent to the localhost to a text file for veryification. As time
passes I might add the ability to dump this to CSV or even a Database.
